Abstract

We present the dependence of D production on the charged particle multiplicity in proton-proton col-

lisions at LHC energies. We show that, in a framework of source coherence, the open charm production

exhibits a growth with the multiplicity which is stronger than linear in the high density domain. This

departure from linearity was previously observed in the J/ψ inclusive data from proton-proton collisions at

7 TeV and was successfully described in our approach. Our assumption, the existence of coherence effects

present in proton-proton collisions at high energy, applies for high multiplicity proton-proton collisions in

the central rapidity region and should affect any hard observable.

1 Introduction

The available data recoiled at RHIC [1, 2, 3, 4] and LHC [5, 6, 7] on heavy-ion collisions have already shown

several features which indicate the formation of a high-density partonic medium. In which concerns pp collisions

at LHC energies, the energy densities achieved in the high multiplicity events are similar to the ones reached

in CuCu central collisions or AuAu peripheral collisions at
√
sNN = 200 GeV. It is then mandatory to look for

observables which could reflect the formation of a high density medium, similar to the one already observed in

heavy-ion collisions.

One of those signals, already reported by the ALICE collaboration [8, 9], was the rise of central rapidity J/ψ

inclusive production in the highest multiplicity events obtained in pp collisions at 7 TeV, that was successfully

reproduced in the source interaction framework [10].

Here we address to the production of open charm mesons. We will restrict ourselves to the study of the

lightest ones, D0, D+ and D−, and we will comment on the other states.

2 The model

Let us recall the essential ingredients of our model. Our main assumption consists on considering high-energy

hadronic collisions as driven by the exchanged of colour sources –strings– between the projectile and the target.

Those sources have finite spatial extension and thus they can interact, reducing their effective number.

Note that one can distinguish between soft and hard sources, depending on their transverse mass, i.e. their

quark composition and their transverse momentum. Note also that their transverse size is determined by this

transverse mass, since rT ∝ 1/mT . The softness of the source maximizes its possibility of interaction, since
its transverse size will be larger.

The main consequence is that the bulk properties –as the total multiplicities– that are driven by the soft

sources are going to be affected by their initial interactions, in particular reducing the total number of produced

particles in similar way as shadowing or saturation do. On the other hand, the hard events are less affected by

source interaction and can be taken as proportional to the number of collisions.

Specifically, in our model each parton-parton collision is reflected as the number of initially produced sources

Ns. The hard events in pp collisions are mainly controlled by this number, i.e. the number of collisions. On the

contrary, the multiplicity distribution dN/dη –mainly soft– is not proportional to the number of collisions, but

mostly to the number of participants. This reduction can be considered as a consequence of shadowing in the

case of pA or AA collisions [11], parton saturation [12] or, as it is the case here, string interactions [13]. As a

consequence, the charged particle multiplicities can suffer a reduction due to the interaction among the sources

and behave roughly as
√
Ns. The above assumptions are similar to the fact that the shadowing effects decrease

with the hardness of the probe.

In particular, in our approach the multiplicity distribution is given by

dN

dη
= F (ρ)Nsµ1 (1)

where µ1 corresponds to the multiplicity of a single source in the rapidity range of interest, Ns is the number

of produced sources and F (ρ) corresponds to the damping factor induced by the source interaction,

F (ρ) =

√
1− e−ρ

ρ
. (2)

ρ corresponds to the source density, ρ = Nsσ0σ , being σ0 the transverse size of one source and σ the transverse

area of the collision.

In our previous paper [10] we have assumed the proportionality between the number of produced J/ψ and

the number of collisions,

The above equation leads to the following behaviour for the J/ψ production: At low multiplicities, where the

where the linear dependence changes to an squared dependence when high multiplicity events are at play. This

which agrees extremely well the available experimental data [8, 9].

Let us now face the problem of open charm production. We have considered that, in first approximation, D

production is driven both by light and hard sources, due to their mixed composition. Both contributions are

to be taken at 50%. The soft contribution will follow the linear behaviour with the multiplicity, while the hard

one will behave as the J/ψ does, according to eq. (7),

In order to compare with the available pp experimental data, we need to compute the dependence of the

source densities with the multiplicities. In Table 1, we show our values for the available experimental beams

together with our results for J/ψ and D production according to eqs. (7,8). Note that the D meson results

shown in the above table corresponds to the lightest ones, i.e. D0, D+, D−, and are to be taken as pT integrated,

i.e. pT > 0 GeV.

The experimental results on open charm production are presented for different species and different pT cuts.

In order to compare with experimental data [14], we have taken the lowest pT beam, i.e. 2 < pT < 4 GeV for

D0 and D+ production. In Fig. 1, we show our results compared to experimental ALICE data [14] for D meson

production in pp collisions at 7 TeV in the central rapidity range.

Figure 1: Our results on D meson production (red line) for pp collisions in the central rapidity range, together

with the experimental data from the ALICE Collaboration [14]. The linear behaviour (black line) is also plotted.

We observe a good agreement between our result and the experimental data for D0 and D+ production.

Note that, in which concerns D∗ production, its departure from linearity is to be more important, due to its

higher mass. Moreover, we can advance that the departure from linearity should also be more important for



5

the high pT beams when compare to the low pT beams.

In Fig. 2, our results on D and J/ψ are plotted and compared to experimental data.

Figure 2: Our results on D meson production in the central rapidity range (red line) and on J/ψ production

in the central (continuous blue line) and in the forward (dashed blue line) rapidity range for pp collisions at

7 TeV, together with the experimental data from the ALICE Collaboration [14]. The linear behaviour (black

line) is also plotted.

Note that the J/ψ production obeys a quadratic dependence with the multiplicity in the central rapidity

region, while it is closer to linear dependence in the forward rapidity one [10].

3 Conclusions

In conclusion, we have reproduced here the rise of D and J/ψ production for the highest multiplicity events at

central rapidity observed by the ALICE collaboration in pp collisions. This increase may be a consequence of

the formation of a high density medium in pp collisions at LHC energies.

At these high densities, the coherence among the sources can lead to a reduction of their effective number

–initially proportional to the number of collisions. This reduction would mainly affect the soft observables, as

the total multiplicity, while the hard production would remain unaltered. In this case, the linear dependence

of D and J/ψ production on the charged particle multiplicity obtained for low multiplicities –where the parton

densities are smaller–, changes to an squared dependence when high multiplicity events are at play. Moreover,

this departure from linearity should increase with the hardness of the studied observable. This means that,

for the same pT and rapidity range, the J/ψ production will be higher than the D
0 production for the high

multiplicity events. For the same particle specie there should be also an ordering in pT , i.e. the highest pT

particles should show a most important departure of linearity.

Note that any additional J/ψ suppression –due to the possibility of string or source percolation–, which could

lead to a corresponding increase of the D production, cannot be at play at these energies and multiplicities, since

the density of strings is well below the threshold for percolation, η > 1. This threshold can ben nevertheless

achieved in pp collisions at higher energies, i.e. 14 TeV, for the high multiplicity events,

pPb collisions at 5.02 TeV. In the latest case, the application of our model is not completely straightforward,

since other cold nuclear matter effects can be at play here.
