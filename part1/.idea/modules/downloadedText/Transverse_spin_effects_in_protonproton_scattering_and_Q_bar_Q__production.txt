Abstract. We discuss transverse spin effects caused by the spin-flip part of the Pomeron coupling
with the proton. The predicted spin asymmetries in proton-proton scattering and QQ production
in proton-proton and lepton-proton reactions are not small and can be studied in future polarized
experiments.

In this report, we discuss what future facilities can be used to ascertain the existence
of the spin spin-flip part of the Pomeron coupling. The spin structure of the Pomeron
was analysed by different authors (see [1, 2] and reference therein). Its manifestation
can be investigated in the elastic pp scattering at low t [3]. We shall analyze here the
single spin asymmetries in the elastic pp scattering near the diffraction minimum and of
the QQ̄ production in the pp reaction. The double spin asymmetries of QQ̄ production in
lepton-proton reactions for a longitudinally polarized lepton and a transversely polarized
proton will be studied too. It will be shown that these asymmetries are sensitive to the
spin-flip part of the Pomeron coupling and predicted asymmetries are not small, about
10%. They can be used to obtain information about the spin structure of the Pomeron
coupling. To study spin effects in diffractive reactions, we use the two- gluon exchange
model , which is directly connected with the Pomeron. On the other hand, diffractive
processes can be expressed in terms of the generalized or skewed parton distribution
(GPD) in the nucleon Fζ (x), Kζ (x) [4]. The connection of the two-gluon model with
GPD will be shown.

The two-gluon coupling with the proton can be parametrized in the form [5]

V αβpgg(p, t,xP, l⊥) = B(t,xP, l⊥)(γ
α pβ + γβ pα)

+
iK(t,xP, l⊥)

2m
(pασ βγrγ + pβ σ αγrγ)+ .... (1)

Here m is the proton mass. In the matrix structure (1) we wrote only the terms with
the maximal powers of a large proton momentum p which are symmetric in the gluon
indices α,β . The structure proportional to B(t, ...) determines the spin-non-flip contri-
bution. The term ∝ K(t, ...) leads to the transverse spin-flip at the vertex.

The spin-dependent cross section of diffractive processes are expressed in terms of
the soft gluon coupling (1), which in the case of hadron production is convoluted with
the hard hadron production amplitude. The spin asymmetries are expressed in terms of
the functions B(t, ...) and K(t, ...) integrated over the gluon transverse momentum l⊥.




The helicity-non-flip and helicity-flip amplitudes of the polarized proton off the spin-
less particle (a meson or unpolarized proton) can be written in terms of the invariant
functions B̃ and K̃

F++(s, t) = is[B̃(t)] f (t); F+−(s, t) = is

√

|t|
m

K̃(t) f (t), (2)

where f(t) is determined by the Pomeron coupling with the other hadron. The functions
B̃ and K̃ are defined by the integrated over l⊥ structures from (1).

There are some models that provide spin-flip effects which do not vanish at high
energies. In the model [1], the amplitudes K and B have a phase shift caused by the soft
Pomeron rescattering effect. The vector diquarks in the diquark model [2] generate the
K amplitude which is out of phase with the Pomeron contribution to the amplitude B.
The value |K̃|/|B̃| ∼ 0.1 found in [1, 2] will be used in our estimations of the asymmetry
in diffractive hadron production.

The single spin asymmetry is determined by

The models [1, 2] describe the experimental data on single spin transverse asymmetry
AN [6] quite well. Thus, the weak energy dependence of spin asymmetries in exclusive
reactions is now not in contradiction with the experiment [1, 7].

FIGURE 1. Predictions of the model [1] for single-spin transverse asymmetry of the pp scattering at
RHIC energies [7]. Error bar indicates expected statistical errors for the PP2PP experiment at RHIC.

In the diffraction minimum the imaginary part of the amplitude B is equal to zero
and the asymmetry is determined by the product (ReB ImK). Thus, the asymmetry
near the diffraction minimum is sensitive to the imaginary part of the spin–flip K,
amplitude and study of the AN asymmetry in the PP2PP experiment at RHIC can give
a direct information about the energy dependence of the amplitude K. There are model
predictions for AN in this region. The model [1] predicts a large negative value of AN
asymmetry near the diffraction minimum which weakly depends on s at the RHIC energy



range [7] and AN is of about 10% for |t| ∼ 3GeV2 (Fig.1). Other model predictions for
single-spin asymmetry at small momentum transfer was discussed in [8].

The single spin asymmetry of diffractive QQ̄ production in polarized pp reaction was
estimated in [9]. It was found that AN is determined by Eq. (3) which is modified by the
amplitude of hard QQ̄ production. The expected value of the single spin asymmetry in
this case is about 5% in the RHIC energy range.

Let us study now diffractive double spin asymmetries of QQ̄ production in lepton-
proton reactions for a longitudinally polarized lepton and a transversely polarized proton
within the two-gluon model. This model should describe the cross sections of hard and
light quark production at small x < 0.1 as well. The spin-dependent cross section can be
written in the form

Here C(xP,Q
2) is a normalization function which is common for the spin average and

spin dependent cross section; N(±) is determined by a sum of graphs integrated over the
gluon momenta l and l′. The function N(+) determines the spin-average cross section.

The other form of interference between B and K with respect to (3) appears in (7)
because we consider here the double spin effects. The large value of asymmetry will
appear for a small phase shift between the amplitudes.

The asymmetry is approximately proportional to the ratio of polarized and spin–

The spin-dependent contribution to the asymmetry which is proportional to ~k⊥
~S⊥

in (7) will be analyzed for the case when the transverse jet momentum~k⊥ is parallel
to the target polarization ~S⊥. The asymmetry is maximal in this case. To observe this
contribution to asymmetry, it is necessary to distinguish experimentally the quark and
antiquark jets. If we do not separate events with~k⊥ for the quark jet, e.g., the resulting
asymmetry will be equal to zero because the transverse momentum of the quark and
antiquark are equal and opposite in sign.

The predicted asymmetry for heavy cc̄ production at the COMPASS energies is shown
in Fig.2. The asymmetry for light quark production is approximately of the same order
of magnitude. The expected AlT asymmetry for light quark production at HERMES

is shown in Fig.3. The function CQQ̄
k

in (8) is quite large, about 1.5 at the HERMES

energy for k2⊥ = 1.3GeV
2, Q2 = 5GeV2, xP = 0.1, y = 0.5, and |t|= 0.3GeV2. The spin–

dependent cross section vanishes for Q2 → 0, while the spin–average cross section is
constant in this limit. As a result, the asymmetry can be estimated as AlT ∝ Q

2/(Q2+Q20)
with Q20 ∼ 1GeV2. This shows a possibility of studying the polarized gluon distribution
Kg

ζ
(x) in the COMPASS and HERMES experiment at Q2 ≥ 0.5GeV2.
The contribution to asymmetry ∝ ~Q~S⊥ in (7) is simpler to study experimentally. The

expected asymmetry in this case is not small too, about 5% or a little bit smaller. The
predicted CQQ̄

Q
in (8) in this case is about 0.3. In contrast to the AklT term, the A

Q
lT

asymmetry has a strong mass dependence [5].
Similar analyses have been carried out for diffractive J/Ψ production which is de-

scribed by the same two-gluon exchange. Unfortunately, the double spin AlT asymmetry
in this case is proportional to xP which is fixed here by xP ∼ (m2V +Q2 + |t|)/(sy). As a



result the expected asymmetry is small and Cg(J/Ψ) ∼ 0.007 for vector meson produc-
tion in the HERMES energy range. It is difficult to expect experimental study of such
small asymmetry.

I this report we have studied the transverse asymmetries caused by the spin structure
of the Pomeron coupling with the proton. Similar to the low energy experiments [6] we
predict the large negative asymmetry in the vicinity of the diffractive minimum in elastic
pp scattering at the RHIC energies. If the weak energy dependence of the asymmetry
in this region is found in the PP2PP experiment at the RHIC, it will give a definite
indication of the spin-dependent Pomeron coupling. Another possibility is to study the
single-spin asymmetry of diffractive QQ̄ production at RHIC which is predicted to be
about 5%.

The diffractive hadron leptoproduction for a longitudinally polarized lepton and a
transversely polarized proton at high energies has been studied. The AlT asymmetry
is found to be proportional to the ratio of structure functions AlT = CK

g/Fg. If the
Pomeron has a spin structure, the ratio Kg/Fg should have a weak x dependence at low
x < 0.1. The AlT asymmetry can be used to get information on the transverse distribution

KgxP(xP, t) from experiment if the function C in (8) is not small. We predict that C
QQ̄

for the term ∝~k⊥~S⊥ and C

∼ 0.3 for the contribution ∝ ~Q~S⊥ in the asymmetry (7).
We can see that the expected values of C are quite large and such asymmetries might be
excellent objects to study transverse spin effects in the proton– gluon coupling.

The results presented here should be applicable to the reactions with heavy quarks.
For processes with light quarks, our predictions can be used in the small x region (x≤ 0.1
e.g.) where the contribution of quark GPD is expected to be small. In the case of light
quark production the polarized u and d quark GPD might be studied together with the
gluon distribution in the region of not small x ≥ 0.1. Such experiments can be conducted
at the HERMES and COMPASS spectrometers for a transversely polarized target and
future eRHIC. We conclude that important information on the spin–dependent GPD
Kζ (x) at small x can be obtained from the asymmetries in diffractive pp and l p reactions
for longitudinally polarized lepton and transversely polarized hadron targets.
