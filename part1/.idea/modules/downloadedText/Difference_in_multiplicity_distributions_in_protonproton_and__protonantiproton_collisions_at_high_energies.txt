Difference in multiplicity distributions in proton-proton and proton-antiproton
collisions at high energies

Radchenko N.V.∗

Novgorod State University, Novgorog-the-Great, Russia†

Secondary charged hadrons multiplicity distributions in proton-proton and proton-
antiproton collisions differ on principle. There are three types of inelastic processes in
proton-antiproton scattering. The first type is production of secondary hadrons shower
at gluon string decay. The second type is shower produced from two quark strings decay, the
third type is shower produced from three quark strings decay. At the same time there are
only two types of inelastic processes for proton-proton scattering - gluon string shower and
two quark strings shower. Theoretical description of multiplicity distributions is obtained
for proton-proton collisions at energies from 44.5 GeV to 200 GeV and for proton-antiproton
collisions at energies from 200 GeV to 1800 GeV. The difference between proton-proton
and proton-antiproton multiplicity distributions is discussed. The predictions of multiplicity
distribution and mean multiplicity at LHC energy are given.

I. INTRODUCTION

Multiplicity distributions and total cross
sections are the main characteristics of hadrons
multiple production at high energies. Analy-
sis of secondary hadrons multiplicity distribu-
tions is very important for verification of different
phenomenological approaches and models. Ex-
perimental data on multiplicity distribution are
highly informative and can be measured with suf-
ficient accuracy which gives significant advantage
when comparing with theoretical calculations.

II. LOW CONSTITUENTS NUMBER

MODEL AND TOTAL CROSS SECTIONS

We are based on the Low Constituents
Number Model (LCNM) which was proposed by
V.A. Abramovsky and O.V. Kancheli in 1980 [1].
Three steps are concretized in this model: prepa-
ration of colliding hadrons initial state; interac-
tion; moving apart of reaction products.

1) On the first step before the collision there
is small number of constituents in hadrons. They
are valence quarks and few gluons which fill in
the whole spectrum in rapidity space.

nancial support and hospitality

2) On the second step the hadrons interac-
tion is carried out by gluon exchange between the
valence quarks and initial gluons and the hadrons
gain the color charge.

3) On the third step after interaction the col-
ored hadrons move apart and when the distance
between them becomes larger than the confine-
ment radius, the lines of color electric field gather
into the string. This string breaks out into sec-
ondary hadrons.

In the model total cross sections of proton-
proton and proton-antiproton collisions are de-
scribed by the following formulae

σ
p(p̄)p
tot = 63.52s

−0.358 ∓ 35.43s−0.56 +
+σ0 + σ1 ln s+ σ2(ln s)

2 +

+σ3(ln s)
3 + [higher powers of ln s]. (1)

where first two terms present non vacuum contri-
butions and were taken from the paper by Cudell
et. al. [2]. There are also constant term and
terms proportional to powers of logarithm of full
energy. Constant term corresponds to gluon ex-
change between initial states containing only va-
lence quarks. Powers of logarithm are equal to
number of gluons in initial states of hadrons.

The fitting of formulae (1) to total cross sec-
tions of pp and pp̄ collisions (Fig.1, data were
taken from [3]) showed that there are only two
gluons in initial state. Contribution of the third
gluon is about 1 mb at energy 14 TeV and thus

is negligible. The values of parameters are σ0 =
20.08 ± 0.42, σ1 = 1.14 ± 0.13, σ2 = 0.16 ± 0.01.

Having limited number of gluons we can de-
scribe the types of inelastic processes in proton-
proton and proton-antiproton interactions.

III. THREE TYPES OF INELASTIC

PROCESSES

From the obtained result of presence of only
two gluons in initial state it follows existence of
three types of inelastic processes in pp and pp̄
collisions.

There are three types of inelastic processes
in proton-antiproton interaction. The first type is
production of hadrons shower from decay of gluon
string, it corresponds to constant contribution to
total cross sections (Fig. 2a). The second type is
shower produced from decay of two quark strings,
it corresponds to contributions from one and two
gluons (Fig. 2b). The third type is shower pro-
duced from decay of three quark strings, it cor-
responds to part of contribution from two gluons
(Fig. 2c). In this case quark strings are produced
between every quark of proton and antiquark of
antiproton.

At the same time there are only two types of
inelastic processes in proton-proton interaction,
they are shower from gluon string (Fig. 2d) and
shower from two quark strings (Fig. 2e,f). There
are no three quark strings in pp interaction be-

and pp interaction (d – f). Solid lines correspond to
quarks and antiquarks, wavy lines to gluons, spirals to
strings. Interaction in final state is marked by dashed

cause in this case strings can be formed between
quark of one proton and diquark of another pro-
ton.

IV. MULTIPLICITY DISTRIBUTIONS

FOR DIFFERENT PROCESSES

We suppose that hadrons multiplicity dis-
tribution in gluon string is normal distribution
(Fig. 3).

Gluon pairs are sequentially produced in fi-
nal state marked by dashed block. This produc-
tion takes place until energy of pairs approaches
hadrons mass. Then gluon pairs decays at several
observable hadrons.

Every diagram of this type gives certain
number of secondary hadrons. Number of such
diagrams is considerably large. There is no sup-

pression on energy because exchange is of vector
type. Contributions from this diagrams have the
same order of magnitude. So secondary hadrons
multiplicity as random variable has to obey nor-
mal distribution because of central limit theorem
of probability theory. Thus multiplicity distribu-
tion in gluon string is normal distribution.

We suppose that hadrons multiplicity distri-
bution in quark string is negative binomial distri-
bution (NBD). This is in good agreement with
data on e+e− annihilation at low energies where
one quark string is produced with assurance. So
multiplicity distribution in two quark strings is
convolution of two NBD, namely NBD with dou-
ble parameters, and in three quark strings it is
convolution of three NBD, namely NBD with
triple parameters.

Experimental charged multiplicities are nor-
malized on non single diffraction cross sections,
σnsd = σtot − σel − σsd. Pomeron contributions
are the same as for total cross sections

here we divided formulae by constant term for
convenience.

The fitting of vacuum contributions to non
single diffraction cross sections is shown on Fig. 4,
data were taken from [4, 5]. The value of χ2 to
number of degrees of freedom 14 to 8 is caused
by difference between data of UA4 and UA5 col-
laborations.

The obtained coefficients δnsd1 = 0.075 ±
0.011 and δnsd2 = 0.007 ± 0.001 determine the
weights of configurations with gluon string, two
quark strings, three quark strings.

Weight of normal distribution is defined by
formulae (3) and it is the same for pp and pp̄
collisions.

Weights of double NBD are different for
pp (4) and pp̄ (5) interactions because in case of
proton-antiproton configuration with two gluons
also gives contribution to three quark strings. It
is taken into account by coefficient c, which does
not depend on energy of collision.

V. EXPERIMENTAL DATA ON

DISTRIBUTIONS

With assumptions stated in previous sec-
tions we described experimental data on charged
particle multiplicity for pp collisions at energy
range from

√
s = 44.5 to 200 GeV [5, 6] and for

pp̄ collisions from 200 to 1800 GeV [7] – [9].
In case of pp interaction weights of distribu-

tions are strictly defined by formulaes (3), (4). In
Fig. 5 multiplicity distributions in pp interaction
at

√
s = 44.5 and

√
s = 62.2 GeV are shown.

But in case of pp̄ interaction we have ad-

so weights of distributions are defined by formu-
laes (3), (5) and (6). The last two formulaes
have undefined parameter – coefficient c which
describes appearance of three quark strings.

On the left side the case when 25 per cent of two

ons give three quark strings. Values of χ2 to num-

cases, χ2/ndf = 4/29. As energy increases higher
value of coefficient c gives slightly better value of
χ2/ndf , for example, at the highest available en-
ergy

s = 1800 GeV χ2/ndf = 138/115 when

c = 0.25 and χ2/ndf = 126/115 when c = 0.75

After fitting all data we obtained energy

strings ad thus we can predict the multiplicity
distribution for pp collisions at 900 GeV. This is
the first high enough energy for which it will be
possible to compare multiplicity distributions for
pp and pp̄ interactions directly after start up of
LHC. In the case of c = 0.25 the shapes for both
reactions are practically the same. But in the case
of c = 0.75 the systematic difference may be ob-
served in region of “shoulder” given very precise
measurements (Fig. 8).

VI. PREDICTIONS FOR LHC ENERGY

14 TEV

We predict the value of total cross section at√
s = 14 TeV to be

σpptot = 101.30 ± 6.65.

The multiplicity distribution for pp interac-

tion can be described as sum of normal distri-
bution in gluon string and double negative bino-
mial distribution in two quark strings. Weights
of these distributions are strictly defined by for-
mulaes (3), (4). Parameters of normal distri-
bution are mean multiplicity in gluon string n̄gl
and standard deviation σgl. Parameters of double
NBD are mean multiplicity in quark string n̄q and
shape parameter kq. Since parameters of quark
and gluon strings must be obtained at simultane-
ous fitting of pp and pp̄ distributions, they con-
tain uncertainty of three quark strings coefficient
c. So we have two sets of energy dependencies for
gluon and quark string parameters.

It will be possible to distinguish between two
values of coefficient c when experimental data are
available.
