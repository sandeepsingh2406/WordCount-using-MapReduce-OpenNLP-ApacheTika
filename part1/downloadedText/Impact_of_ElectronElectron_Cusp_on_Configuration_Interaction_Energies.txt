The effect of the electron-electron cusp on the convergence of configuration interaction (CI) wave
functions is examined. By analogy with the pseudopotential approach for electron-ion interactions,
an effective electron-electron interaction is developed which closely reproduces the scattering of
the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zero electron-electron separation. The exact
many-electron wave function for this smooth effective interaction has no cusp at zero electron-
electron separation. We perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms,
both with the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and with the smooth effective electron-electron
interaction. We find that convergence of the CI expansion of the wave function for the smooth
electron-electron interaction is not significantly improved compared with that for the divergent
Coulomb interaction for energy differences on the order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary to
popular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting factor, to within chemical
accuracy, for CI calculations.

I. INTRODUCTION

The primary difficulty in solving the Schrödinger equa-
tion for many-electron systems arises from the presence
of the electron-electron interaction, which results in a
problem non-separable in the electron coordinates. Con-
figuration interaction (CI) calculations use an expansion
of the many-body wave function in configuration state
functions (CSF) given by spin coupled sums of determi-
nants built from single-particle orbitals. One of the cen-
tral difficulties for the convergence of the CI expansion
is thought to arise from the behaviour of the Coulomb
interaction at small electron-electron separations [1–10].
The many-body wave function must have an appropriate
cusp at electron coalescences so that the infinite Coulomb
interaction term is exactly cancelled by an opposite di-
vergence of the kinetic energy [11].
It is often stated in the literature that failure of the

CI expansion to reproduce the correct electron cusp, i.e.
the short-range part of the Coulomb hole, leads to a slow
convergence in the energy with respect to the number
of CSF’s [3]. While this has been shown [2,5] in the
asymptotic regime (i.e. very large angular momentum l
and energy errors of the order of 10−6 Hartree), it is not
clear that it applies in the practical regime (mHartree
accuracy) for multi-electron systems.
Explicit inclusion of terms in the interelectronic dis-

tance (r12 methods) [12,4] or the use of correlated (gem-
inal) Gaussian basis functions [13] significantly improve
the convergence of a CI calculation. For the helium atom,
the inclusion of r12 terms [5] yields an expansion in partial
waves converging asymtotically as l−6 or better, instead
of a slow l−3, where l is the maximum angular momentum
in the expansion. Baker et al. [14] also showed that using
basis functions with the same analytic structure as the
true wave function (depending on powers and logarithms
of r12) leads to a reduced expansion length. The suc-
cess of methods explicitly including r12 terms has been

attributed to their correct description of the short-range
part of the interaction.
A completely different point of view, taken by Gilbert

in 1963 [15], is that the difficulty of CI wave functions in
describing short-range effects of the cusp are energetically
unimportant and that the benefit of the explicitly corre-
lated approach is that the entire Coulomb hole, with a
size on the order of the atomic orbitals, is much easier to
describe in terms of interelectronic coordinates. Gilbert’s
suggestion appears to have received little attention and
the idea that smoothing out the Coulomb potential and
removing the cusp altogether will automatically lead to
an improved CI convergence has been stated in the liter-
ature [16,9]. However, no systematic studies of the effect
of the electron cusp on CI energy convergence at the level
of interest for chemical accuracy (1 mHartree for total
energies) have been presented.
In this paper, we explore whether a significant im-

provement in the convergence of the CI expansion is
obtained when the true Hamiltonian is replaced by one
which has a smooth and finite electron-electron interac-
tion (pseudo-interaction) at short distances and, conse-
quently, smooth eigenfunctions with no cusps.
Surprisingly, in calculations for the He and Be atoms,

we find that removing the divergence of the Coulomb
potential at electron-electron coalescences does not sig-
nificantly reduce the length of the CI expansion, thereby
substantiating the argument put forward by Gilbert [15]
that the slow convergence should be attributed to dif-
ficulties in describing, not the interelectron cusp, but
the intermediate-range electronic correlation. The poor
treatment of the interelectron cusp in the CI expansion is
not a limiting factor at the mHartree level of accuracy on
the total energy. To further confirm this result, we calcu-
late the energy within quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for
the true electron-electron interaction with accurate wave
functions which explicitly contain interelectronic coordi-
nates, and then deliberately remove the short-range cor-

1




relation term related to the cusp, keeping other parts
of the wave function unchanged. We find that the re-
moval of the cusp has a very small effect on the vari-
ational energy. Finally, we demonstrate that the con-
vergence behavior of the CI expansion as a function of
angular momentum in the range practical for many ap-
plications (l < 6) is largely unaffected by the smoothing
of the electron cusps. Therefore, the angular momentum
convergence numerically observed by other authors [7] is
related to problems associated with intermediate range
correlations, not the cusp region as such.
In Sec. II, we describe the pseudopotential used for

the electron-electron interaction and briefly present the
QMC and CI methods. In Sec. III, we report the QMC
and CI energies for He and Be atoms using the true and
pseudo electron interaction. In Appendices A and B,
we discuss the numerical generation and accuracy of the
electron pseudo-interaction, and in Appendix C we define
a short-range correlation term which can be associated
with it. In Appendix D, we briefly discuss the evaluation
of two-electron integrals for the pseudo-interaction.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

A. Electron-electron Pseudo-interaction

When modifying the short-distance electron-electron
interaction, we wish to keep the intermediate- and long-
range correlation properties of the many-body eigen-
states unchanged. This will allow us to isolate systemati-
cally the effects of the short-range cusp-like behaviour in
the wave function. To achieve this, our new (smooth) in-
teraction should ideally have electron-electron scattering
properties identical to the true interaction for all ener-
gies. If this were the case, all many-electron eigenvalues
would be identical for both interactions. While this ideal
cannot be exactly realized, we expect that a potential
with the same scattering properties as the true interac-
tion over a sufficiently wide range of scattering energies
will give many-electron eigenvalues very close to the true
ones.
This goal for electron-electron scattering is analogous

to the problem of electron-ion scattering addressed in the
well-established pseudopotential method [17]. In that ap-
proach, the aim is to produce a smooth electron-ion po-
tential which reproduces the single-particle eigenvalues
of the true system over a range of energies, and has the
same single-particle wave functions outside some suitably
chosen cut-off radius rc. Such pseudopotentials are gen-
erated for the isolated atom but may then be used with a
high level of accuracy in molecules and solids. In solids,
the smoothness of the potential greatly improves the con-
vergence of plane-wave expansions for single-particle or-
bitals [18].

tential methods in the context of the electron-ion scat-

functions of the electron separation r.

tering problem, we generate a norm-conserving pseudo-
interaction for the two-electron scattering problem,
which will replace the true e2/r electron-electron interac-
tion inside a cut-off radius rc. Since the electron-electron
interaction is repulsive and has no bound states for an
isolated pair of electrons, we use, with some minor mod-
ifications, the generalized norm-conserving method de-
vised by Hamann [19] to generate pseudopotentials for
electron-ion interactions at unbound, scattering state en-
ergies. The numerical details of this approach are pre-
sented in Appendix A.
In Fig. 1, we show a pseudo-interaction potential Vps

generated by this approach, along with the true e2/r in-
teraction and a smooth but not norm-conserving inter-
action, Verf(r) = e

2erf(r/rc)/r, as used by Savin and
coworkers [20] in a different context. In Appendix B, the
accuracy of such scattering potentials in reproducing the
exact eigenstate energies is analyzed qualitatively using
first-order perturbation theory. In Appendix C, we de-
fine a short-range inter-electronic correlation term, which
can be directly related to the replacement of the divergent
Coulomb interaction with a smooth norm-conserving in-
teraction.

B. Quantum Monte Carlo Calculations

We employ QMC methods to determine accurate en-
ergies both for the Coulomb and the pseudo-interaction.
The wave functions Ψ used in QMC are of the form given
in Ref. [21] and explicitly depend on the inter-electronic

2



coordinates. They include parameterized terms to de-
scribe electron-nucleus, electron-electron and electron-
electron-nucleus correlation, as follows:

Ψ =

J(ri, rj , rij) . (1)

D↑n and D

n are the Slater determinants of single particle

orbitals for the spin-up and down electrons, respectively,
and J is a Jastrow factor of the form,

J(ri, rj , rij) =
∏

i

exp (Ai)
∏

ij

exp (Bij)
∏

exp (Pij), (2)

where A is an electron-nuclear term (which could be
omitted if a sufficiently large single particle basis were
used in constructing the determinantal part), B is an
electron-electron term incorporating the cusp at small
rij , and P is a smooth function of the electron coordi-
nates, ri and rj , as discussed in detail in Ref. [21]. For
the pseudo-interaction calculations, the B term is omit-
ted. The parameters in the determinant and Jastrow
factor are optimized within QMC using the variance min-
imisation method [22] and the accuracy is tested at the
variational level. The wave function is then used in dif-
fusion Monte Carlo (DMC), which produces the best en-
ergy within the fixed-node approximation (i.e. the lowest-
energy state with the same nodes as the trial wave func-
tion).
For a given interaction, this method yields the ex-

act eigenvalue (within statistical sampling noise) for the
ground state of the He isoelectronic series since the sin-
glet ground state wave function of a two-electron system
is nodeless. For He, only one determinant is used in the
wave function. For the Be atom, the 2s and 2p configura-
tions are included in the determinantal part of the wave
function and DMC gives the best energy subject to the
fixed-node condition. To isolate the effect of the pseudo-
interaction from the fixed-node approximation, we keep
the nodal structure of the wave function fixed while mod-
ifying the electron-electron interaction.

C. Configuration Interaction Calculations

The CI calculations are performed using the Monte
Carlo configuration interaction (MCCI) method [23,24].
In a MCCI calculation, a coefficient threshold cmin is de-
fined, configurations are randomly generated, and, after
a variational calculation, coefficients of magnitude be-
low cmin are rejected. This procedure is repeated until
a desired degree of convergence in the CI calculation is
achieved. A full CI (FCI) calculation can be obtained for
cmin = 0. The fact that the MCCI procedure does not
rely on a pre-selection of CSF’s makes it well-suited for
our study: the dynamical selection of configurations al-
lows for rejection of CSF’s which may no longer be needed
with the smooth electron interaction.

For use in the CI approach, the pseudo-interaction Vps
is represented (in Hartree atomic units) as a sum of the
smooth function Verf plus nG Gaussian terms, as follows:

Vps(r) =
erf(r/rc)

r
+

nG
∑

i=1

ci exp(−dir2) . (3)

This reproduces the 1/r tail of the Coulomb interaction
and the smooth, finite form of the pseudo-interaction at
short distances. The parameters ci and di are found by
least-squares fitting (for radii r < 3rc) to the numerical
potential, generated as described in Appendix A. For
the CI results presented below, the potential was fitted
using nG = 9. QMC calculations of the He atom energy
with the numerical potential and with the fitted potential
show a negligible difference (less than 0.02 mHartree for
all values of rc < 1 a.u.).
Evaluation of the pseudo-interaction Vps(r) can be im-

plemented in codes for Gaussian integral calculation since
it is possible to compute the two-body matrix elements
both of exp(−d r2) and erf(r/rc)/r in the CI basis. Ma-
trix elements of the interaction erf(r/rc)/r for all s-type
basis functions have already been given in Ref. [20]. For
both types of interaction, a simple modification to the
integral codes is possible if the standard two-electron in-
tegrals are calculated using the method of Rys quadra-
ture [25]. Details of two-body integral evaluation with
the modified form of the electron interaction are given in
Appendix D.

III. He AND Be ATOMIC ENERGIES WITH

PSEUDO-INTERACTIONS

To test the impact of the interelectron cusp on the en-
ergy, we calculate the total energies of He and Be atoms,
replacing the true 1/r electron interaction with the norm-
conserving pseudo-interaction Vps(r), generated for var-
ious values of the cut-off radius rc. For comparison,
we also present results for the smooth but not norm-
conserving potential Verf(r) = erf(r/rc)/r. The results
in this section are obtained from QMC and CI calcula-
tions.

A. Ground State of the He atom

In Fig. 2, we show the singlet ground state energies of
the He atom calculated with a norm-conserving electron-
electron interaction Vps generated as in Sec. II, for various
values of the cut-off radius rc. The values obtained from
QMC (exact) calculations are shown. We also plot the
energies calculated using the Verf(r) interaction. The hor-
izontal line indicates the exact energy E0 = −2.903724
Hartree for the true Coulomb interaction [26].
The calculated QMC energies for Vps and Verf in

Fig. 2 are fitted with polynomial expansions of the form:

text. The horizontal line shows the exact value [26] for the He

c . As discussed

in Appendix B, any potential which differs from the ex-
act 1/r interaction would be expected, from first order
perturbation theory, to converge at least quadratically in
rc to the exact energy E0 for small rc. Since Verf is not
explicitly constructed to eliminate first order errors in
Verf(r) − 1/r, quadratic convergence is seen for Verf and
the fitting parameters are: a = −0.3279, b = −0.3839,
c = 0.6758, d = −0.2622, and e = 0. On the other
hand, the norm-conserving pseudo-interaction construc-
tion of Sec. II A explicitly ensures that the first-order
perturbation correction to the energy is zero. The He
ground state energy as a function of rc using Vps can
indeed be fitted without the quadratic term, and even
the cubic term proves to be small, the polynomial coef-
ficients being: a = 0, b = 0.0188, c = −0.1023, d = 0,
and e = 0.0280. For He, the energies obtained using
Vps(r) are within 1 mHartree of the energy computed
with the true Coulomb interaction for values of rc < 0.4
a.u. Since the typical electron-electron distance in the
He ground state is of the order of 1 a.u., these results in-
dicate that the first peak of the electron pair-distribution
function provides a good measure of how large a cut-off
radius rc may be used to obtain accurate total energies
with Vps(r): rc should be approximately half the radius
at which this first peak occurs. The same criterion for
the largest allowed rc value was found to hold for other
systems (not shown), viz. the He triplet state, the He
isoelectronic series, and multi-electron atoms. In a qual-

itative way, this condition is similar to the criterion used
in the generation of electron-ion pseudopotentials, where
the cut-off radius is chosen to be inside the peak of the
valence electron density.
Also shown in Fig. 2 are the variational energies (with

the true Coulomb electron-electron interaction) obtained
for the He ground state by removing the electron cusps
from the accurate trial wave function which was deter-
mined by variance minimization for use in the DMC cal-
culations, as specified in Eq. C1. This trial wave function
includes considerable variational freedom in the interelec-
tronic terms and obtains 100% of the correlation energy.
As can be seen in Fig. 2, removal of the cusp out to radii
of 0.5 a.u. causes little degradation of the quality of the
energy obtained with this wave function. Thus the suc-
cess of interelectronic terms in obtaining good variational
energies is not primarily due to their description of the
short-range cusp behaviour.
This trend is further borne out when we look at

the convergence of partial CI expansions within a given
single-particle basis set for the MCCI method. The CI
calculations were performed with the correlation consis-
tent polarized valence double-zeta (cc-pVDZ), triple-zeta
(cc-pVTZ), quadruple-zeta (cc-pVQZ) and quintuple-
zeta (cc-pV5Z) basis sets of Dunning [27] with the elec-
tron interaction Vps for various values of rc. All four
basis sets show similar behaviour and we present only
the cc-pVQZ results in detail. Table I shows the correla-
tion energy obtained as a function of cut-off radius rc for
various values of the expansion coefficient threshold cmin.
The full CI result is obtained when cmin = 0.0. For larger
values of the cut-off radius rc (upper rows of table), the
total correlation energy is smaller, as the variation of the
interaction Vps becomes smaller around the typical sepa-
ration distance of the electrons. However, the fraction of
the correlation energy which is recovered at a given CI
threshold level cmin depends little on the value of rc.
Fig. 3 shows the number of CSF’s in the CI expan-

sion as a function of cut-off radius rc for various values
of the expansion coefficient threshold cmin. For values of
cmin > 3 × 10−2, one is quickly reduced to a few CSF’s
and finally to the Hartree-Fock solution. As with the cor-
relation energies, for a given threshold cmin, the number
of CSF’s shows relatively little change for values of rc be-
tween 0 and 0.95. Again, it is worth bearing in mind that
the typical electron-electron separation is 1 a.u. and that
a cut-off radius rc = 0.95 represents a very smooth inter-
action. Thus, removal of electron cusps does not result
in a significant reduction in the number of contributing
configurations in the CI expansion.
We next demonstrate that removal of the electron cusp

does not significantly change the convergence properties
of CI expansions as the highest angular momentum quan-
tum number is increased in the single particle basis sets.
In Fig. 4, FCI energies for He are displayed against in-
creasing basis set size in the correlation consistent series
from Dunning, and hence increasing angular momentum
number in the basis. The convergence in the FCI energy

well, the parameters a and b do not have the asymptotic

higher angular momentum functions are added as L is in-
creased in the Dunning basis sets; (ii) more importantly,
we are not near the asymptotic regime, where expansion
of the short-range cusp would be the dominant energy
correction.

(see Appendix C) used in the DMC calculation (dashed line).

B. Ground State of the Be atom

The qualitative nature of the CI energy convergence
seen in the previous section is not special to the He
atom. Fig. 5 shows the DMC calculated ground state
energies of Be for various cut-off radii rc. Because of the
much smaller radius of the 1s orbital in Be, compared to
He, the energetically appropriate cut-off radius rc for the
pseudo-interaction is substantially smaller. Also shown
in Fig. 5 are the variational energies obtained for the Be
ground state by removing the electron cusps (as defined
in Eq. C1) from the accurate trial wave function which
was determined by variance minimization for use in the
DMC calculations. This trial wave function includes in-
terelectronic terms and obtains 99.5% of the correlation
energy. Removal of the cusp causes significant degrada-
tion of the quality of the wave function only for rc > 0.3
atomic units, which is comparable to the typical sepa-
ration of the 1s electrons. Thus, in Be, as in He, the
success of interelectronic terms in obtaining good varia-
tional energies is not primarily due to their description
of the short-range cusp behaviour.
CI calculations using basis sets with s- and p-functions

(the TZP basis of Ahlrichs et al. [28]), s-, p- and d-
functions (6-311g* [29]), s-, p-, d- and f-functions (the
ANO basis of Widmark et al. [30]) and s-, p-, d-, f- and
g-functions (i.e. the ANO basis, augmented with a g-
function with exponent 1.2) were carried out. The values
of the CI coefficient threshold cmin were taken to be 10

−2,
10−3 and 10−4 for all basis sets. Calculations were car-
ried out at cut-off radii rc of 0 (i.e. Coulomb interaction),
0.1 and 0.2 a.u.
In Tables II and III we present the correlation energy

spectively. Fig. 6 shows the number of CSF’s as a func-
tion of the cut-off radius rc for various values of the CI
coefficient threshold cmin in the MCCI approach. We see
that, especially at the higher levels of accuracy (i.e. small
cmin), neither the fraction of the correlation energy ob-
tained nor the number of CSF’s used depend strongly on
the cut-off radius rc. As we saw in the He atom, remov-
ing the divergence of the Coulomb electron interaction
does not substantially change the CI energy convergence
at this level of accuracy.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have directly explored the effect
of the electron cusp on the convergence of the en-
ergy for CI wave functions. To do so, we introduced
a fictitious electron-electron interaction which, unlike
the true Coulomb potential, does not diverge at elec-
tron coalescences and therefore has many-body eigen-
functions which are smooth there. The smooth poten-
tial is obtained by a method analogous to the well-
established treatment of electron-ion interactions with

smooth, norm-conserving pseudopotentials. These give
scattering properties very similar to the true potential
and improve the convergence of plane-wave expansions
for single-particle wave functions. By analogy, one might
expect that a similar treatment of the electron-electron
interaction would improve the convergence of CI expan-
sions.
For the He and Be atoms, we have compared the CI

expansions of wave functions for the true, Coulomb inter-
action and for smooth pseudo-interactions between the
electrons. We have also compared the variational en-
ergies of highly accurate wave functions containing r12
terms, where the cusp condition is exactly satisfied, with
the energy for the same wave functions, from which the
cusp has been deliberately removed out to a given radius.
The main result of our study is that a description of

the electron cusp as such is not a limiting factor in cal-
culating correlation effects with configuration interaction
methods at the mHartree level of accuracy. We are led
to this conclusion since the replacement of the diver-
gent Coulomb interaction with a finite interaction leaves
the convergence properties largely unchanged. The slow
convergence of CI expansions in this energy range must
be attributed to medium-range correlations, which are
present for both types of electron interaction. The results
obtained by explicitly removing the cusp from accurate
variational wave functions support this conclusion, show-
ing that the cusp of the wave function is not energetically
important. This is found, even when cusp-like behaviour
is removed out to a distance of half the typical interelec-
tronic separation.
When describing correlation effects with explicit r12

methods, it is a mistaken notion to assign the improve-
ment in convergence to their ability to describe the short-

range cusp. Rather, the improvement in convergence at
the mHartree level must be understood in terms of a
better description of medium-range correlations when ex-
pressed in interelectronic coordinates. This fact must be
considered when developing theoretical treatments of the
electronic correlation problem.

APPENDIX A: GENERATION OF ELECTRON

PSEUDO-INTERACTIONS

The procedure for constructing the electron pseudo-
interaction Vps follows Hamann’s construction [19] of gen-
eralised norm-conserving pseudopotentials for electron-
ion scattering, with two modifications: (i) Only two
particles are involved in the generation of the electron-
electron pseudo-interaction, so that we do not need to in-
clude screening potentials; (ii) because we are solving the
scattering problem in the centre of mass frame of the elec-
trons and use the relative coordinate r of the electrons,
the mass of the electron is replaced by the reduced mass
for the two-electron system. In Hartree atomic units, the
interaction potential is V (r) = 1/r and the reduced mass
is 1/2. The radial Schrödinger equation for the relative
motion of two electrons is then

− d
2ul
dr2

+

(

l(l + 1)

r2
+ (V − ǫl)

)

ul = 0, (A1)

where ul(r) is r times the wave function in the relative
coordinates, with angular momentum l and energy ǫl (the
kinetic energy of the separated electrons in the centre of
mass frame).
In the generation of a pseudopotential, the true po-

tential and pseudopotential become identical outside a
suitably chosen cut-off radius rc and are constructed to
have identical scattering phase shifts and energy deriva-
tive of the phase shift at a reference energy ǫl. A smooth
pseudo wave function ups(r) is generated numerically to
ensure “norm-conservation”, i.e. ups(R∞) = ul(R∞) and

∫ R∞

0

ups(r)
2dr =

∫ R∞

0

ul(r)
2dr , (A2)

for all R∞ >> rc. In practice, we choose R∞ ∼ 2.5rc,
as in Ref. [19]. Given ups, a smooth, finite pseudopo-
tential Vps is generated by inversion of the Schrödinger
Eq. A1 for r < R∞, with ul and V substituted by ups and
Vps, respectively. We follow the steps exactly as given in

7



Sec. II of Ref. [19], except where the reduced mass en-
ters in the final inversion, slightly modifying Eq. 12 of
Hamann’s work.
In the norm-conserving pseudopotential approach, dif-

ferent scattering potentials are often generated for differ-
ent values of the angular momentum l. The full many-
body wave function is anti-symmetric with respect to ex-
change of any two electrons. Thus, if the two electrons
have parallel spin, the orbital part of the wave function
must have odd parity and the allowed angular momentum
l must be odd. Thus, the dominant parallel-spin scat-
tering has l = 1. For singlet (anti-parallel) scattering,
the orbital part is symmetric and l must be even, with
dominant allowed angular momentum l = 0. Following
the usual pseudopotential approach, we might then ex-
pect to generate a parallel-spin scattering potential using
l = 1 and an anti-parallel-spin scattering potential using
l = 0. In practice, we find that the l = 0 potential gives
good scattering for both angular momenta and the use
of separate parallel- and anti-parallel-spin potentials is
unnecessary.
Since ǫl is positive, the wave function will oscillate for

large r, and if a node occurs for r < R∞, the inver-
sion of the Schrödinger equation will fail. Thus, the joint
requirements, that rc be sufficiently large to produce a

smooth pseudo-interaction and that R∞
>∼ 2.5rc, effec-

tively limit the maximum reference energy ǫl at which
the pseudo-interaction construction is possible.
We find that the pseudo-interaction is transferable (i.e.

has very similar scattering strength to the true interac-
tion) for energies over a wide range about the reference
energy ǫl, as found previously for electron-ion pseudopo-
tentials. In particular, we find that transferability is best
for energies less than the reference energy at which the
pseudopotential was generated. This would suggest that
the best reference energy to use is the largest energy
compatible with the procedure for inversion of the radial
Schrödinger equation, a choice confirmed by calculations
of many-body eigenstates using pseudo-interaction po-
tentials generated with different values of the reference
energy.

APPENDIX B: FIRST ORDER PERTURBATION

ANALYSIS OF PSEUDO-INTERACTIONS

In this Appendix, we consider the first-order error
in the energy expected for a typical, arbitrary smooth
electron-electron potential which is equal to the exact in-
teraction 1/r outside some (adjustable) cut-off radius rc.
We will assume that the potential is (at least approxi-
mately) of the form

Vrc(r) =
1

rc
U(r/rc) (B1)

where U(r/rc) is some universal function independent
of rc. Clearly both the true interaction 1/r and the

smooth interaction Verf are of this form exactly. Vps
is also approximately of this form. Thus, the difference
∆V between the interaction Vrc(r) and the true electron-
electron interaction 1/r is of the same form:

∆V (r) =
1

rc
∆U(r/rc), (B2)

where ∆U(ρ) is zero for ρ > 1.
Replacing the true electron-electron interaction with

Vrc(r) then gives rise to a first-order energy error:

δǫ(1) = 〈Ψ|∆V |Ψ〉

= 〈Ψ|
(

Vrc −
1

r

)

|Ψ〉, (B3)

where |Ψ〉 is the eigenstate of the many-electron system.
If P (r) is the electron pair distribution function (aver-
aged at the pair separation distance r), the energy error
may be rewritten as:

δǫ(1) =

∫ ∞

0

P (r)
1

rc
∆U(r/rc)4πr

2dr

= r2c

∫ 1

0

P (rcρ)∆U(ρ)4πρ
2dρ. (B4)

If rc is sufficiently small and the pair-distribution func-
tion P (r) does not tend to zero at r = 0, then P (rcρ) may
be replaced by P (0) in the integral and δǫ(1) ≈ KP (0)r2c
for small rc, where K is a constant for the type of inter-
action, defined by

K ≡
∫ 1

0

∆U(ρ)4πρ2dρ. (B5)

The construction of Vps ensures that the energy error
is identically zero for the two-electron scattering at the
reference energy, and therefore K = 0 for Vps. However,
for an arbitrary smooth interaction (such as Verf), K will
not be zero.

APPENDIX C: SHORT-RANGE CORRELATION

TERM OBTAINED FROM NORM-CONSERVING

POTENTIAL

In the generation of the norm-conserving potential dis-
cussed in Appendix A, we obtained a pseudo wave func-
tion ups(r), which is a solution to the radial Schrödinger
equation at the scattering energy ǫl for the pseudo-
interaction, and the wave function ul(r), which is the
corresponding solution for the true Coulomb interaction.
The ratio Jsr = ul/ups of these two functions has the
correct electron cusp (i.e. logarithmic derivative of −1/4
or −1/2 for parallel or anti-parallel spins, respectively, at
r = 0) and tends rapidly to 1 for r > rc. This function Jsr
may be said to contain the short-range cusp behaviour
of the Coulomb scattering solution, since it represents

8



the difference between the scattering wave function for
the divergent potential and that for the finite pseudo-
interaction.
Moreover, if Ψ(r1, . . . , rN ) is a many-electron wave

function (e.g. one which has inter-electronic coordinates
rij explicitly included) with the correct electron cusps,
the function

Ψs = Ψ(r1, . . . , rN )/
∏

i<j

Jsr(rij) (C1)

is smooth at electron coalescences but has very similar
electron correlations for rij > rc. The wave function
Ψs has the electron cusp behaviour of the original wave
function Ψ removed inside the cut-off radius rc, but is
otherwise the same as Ψ. Thus, the energy difference
〈Ψs|H |Ψs〉 − 〈Ψ|H |Ψ〉 is a good measure of the energy
cost of removing the electron cusp behaviour for r <
rc from a correlated wave function, while keeping other
aspects of the wave function (e.g. any benefits there may
be to the inclusion of inter-electronic coordinates in the
form of the trial function) unchanged.

APPENDIX D: EVALUATION OF

TWO-ELECTRON GAUSSIAN INTEGRALS

WITH PSEUDO-INTERACTIONS

In this Appendix, we give details of the evaluation of
two-electron Gaussian basis set integrals for the electron
interactions, Verf and Vps, and their incorporation into
existing electron integral programs.
For the interaction Verf , the necessary modification of

two-electron integrals for all s-type basis functions have
been given by Savin [20]. We do not use Savin’s ap-
proach, but rather directly modify the Rys quadrature
approach of Dupuis, Rys, and King [25], to obtain ma-
trix elements for the interaction Verf in place of those for
1/r12. To evaluate two-electron integrals for the pseudo-
interaction Vps, we use the form given in Eq. 3. This in-
volves the evaluation of integrals with the interaction Verf
and a sum of Gaussian terms. In codes (e.g. the ARGOS
code [31]) which use the Rys quadrature [25] approach for
the evaluation of two-electron integrals with the Coulomb
interaction, these Gaussian terms are already evaluated
in an intermediate stage and may be used in the present
context.
Let us define two-electron integrals of the Coulomb

interaction as

(φiφj |
1

r12
|φkφl)

≡
∫ ∫

φi(r1)φj(r1)
1

r12
φk(r2)φl(r2)dr1dr2 ,

for Gaussian basis functions,

φi(r) = exp(−ai|r −Ri|2)
∏

x,y,z

(x−Xi)nxi .

The Rys scheme represents the 1/r12 term in Gaussian
integral form, to obtain:

(φiφj |
1

r12
|φkφl) =

2√
π

∫ ∞

0

du(φiφj |exp(−u2r212)|φkφl).

(D1)

This integral is then transformed to an integral over the
variable t, where t2 = u2/(ρ + u2) and 1/ρ = 1/(ai +
aj) + 1/(ak + al):

(φiφj |
1

r12
|φkφl) =

∫ 1

0

PL(t) exp(−Xt2) dt , (D2)

where PL is a polynomial and X = ρ|rA − rB|2. Here,
rA and rB are the usual weighted-average centers of the
Gaussian orbital pairs (i, j) and (k, l), respectively, as
given in Ref. [25]. The integration over t is then evaluated
exactly by an n-point quadrature formula:

(φiφj |
1

r12
|φkφl) =

n
∑

α=1

PL(tα)Wα ,

where tα(X) and Wα(X) are determined as in Ref. [25].
We observe that the interaction Verf may be written

in exactly the same form as in Eq. D1, replacing the
upper limit of integration (u = ∞) with u = 1/rc. This
changes the upper limit of integration in the variable t
from 1 to tc = 1/

√

1 + ρr2c in Eq. D2. To use directly
the Rys quadrature approach, we further transform to
the variable t′ = t/tc, to obtain

(φiφj |
erf(r12/rc)

r12
|φkφl) = tc

∫ 1

0

PL(tct
′) exp(−Xt2ct′2) dt′ ,

which can be evaluated as,

(φiφj |
erf(r12/rc)

r12
|φkφl) =

n
∑

α=1

PL(t
′
α)W

′
α ,

where the quadrature points t′α and weights W
′
α are

found by defining X ′ = Xt2c, t
′
α = tctα(X

′), and W ′α =
tcWα(X

′).
We can similarly evaluate the Gaussian terms in

the representation of Vps. Defining the integrand in
Eq. D1, F(u) ≡ (φiφj |exp(−u2r212)|φkφl), we see that
∑

PL(tα)Wα =
∑

AαF(uα), where u2α/ρ = t2α/(1 −
t2α) and Aα = (2/

√
π)[(ρ + u2)3/2/ρ] exp[Xu2/(ρ +

u2)]Wα(X). One may directly modify this finite-point
quadrature summation to evaluate two-electron integrals
for the Gaussian terms, replacing n with nG, Aα with ci,
and u2α with di. We have applied these modifications to
the two-electron integrals within the ARGOS code, part
of the COLUMBUS program package [31].
