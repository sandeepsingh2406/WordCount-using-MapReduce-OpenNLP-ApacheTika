(Dated: 5th February 2008)

We calculate the thermal conductivity of electrons produced by electron-electron Coulomb scat-
tering in a strongly degenerate electron gas taking into account the Landau damping of transverse
plasmons. The Landau damping strongly reduces this conductivity in the domain of ultrarelativistic
electrons at temperatures below the electron plasma temperature. In the inner crust of a neutron
star at temperatures T . 107 K this thermal conductivity completely dominates over the electron
conductivity due to electron-ion (electron-phonon) scattering and becomes competitive with the the
electron conductivity due to scattering of electrons by impurity ions.

I. INTRODUCTION

The electron thermal conductivity is an important ki-
netic property of plasmas in experimental devices, in
metals and semiconductors and in astrophysical objects.
It has been studied for a long time and described in text-
books (see, e.g., Ziman [1], Lifshitz and Pitaevskĭı [2]).
We will show that some aspects of this problem have to
be revised.
Specifically, we will consider the thermal conductiv-

ity of degenerate electrons. It is important in metals,
semiconductors as well as in degenerate cores of evolved
stars (giants, supergiants and, most importantly, white
dwarfs), and in envelopes of neutron stars. It is needed
to study cooling of white dwarfs (e.g., Prada Moroni and
Straniero [3]) and nuclear explosions of massive white
dwarfs as type Ia supernovae (e.g., Baraffe, Heger and
Woosley [4]). In neutron star envelopes it is required for
many reasons — for simulating cooling of isolated neu-
tron stars (see, e.g., Lattimer et al. [5], Gnedin, Yakovlev
and Potekhin [6], Page, Geppert and Weber [7]); for
studying heat propagation and thermal relaxation in a
neutron star envelope in response to the various processes
of crustal energy release. In particular, these processes
include pulsar glitches (e.g., Larson and Link [8], and ref-
erences therein), deep crustal heating of accreting neu-
tron stars in soft X-ray transients (e.g., Ushomirsky and
Rutledge [9]), superbursts as powerful nuclear explosions
at the base of the outer crust of an accreting neutron star
(e.g., Strohmayer and Bildsten [10]; Page and Cumming
[11]).
It is well known, that the electrons give the main con-

tribution into the thermal conductivity of strongly degen-
erate matter. Their thermal conductivity can be written
as

κe =
π2Tk2Bne
3m∗eνe

, νe = νei + νee. (1)

Here, T is the temperature, kB is the Boltzmann con-
stant, ne is the number density of electrons, m

∗

e = µ/c
2,

µ is the electron chemical potential (including the rest-
mass term), and νe is the total effective electron collision

frequency. The latter frequency is the sum of the par-
tial collision frequencies νei and νee. In νei we include
all collisions of electrons mediated by their interactions
with ions (direct Coulomb scattering of electrons by ions
in an ion gas or liquid; electron-phonon scattering in an
ion crystal and electron scattering by impurity ions at
low temperatures). Evidently, Eq. (1) can be rewritten
as

where the partial conductivities κei and κee are deter-
mined, respectively, by the ei and ee collisions.
It is widely believed that the dominant contribution

into κe comes from the ei collisions. The associated
partial conductivity κei has been studied in a number
of papers (e.g., Potekhin et al. [12], Gnedin et al. [6]
and references therein). The partial thermal conductiv-
ity κee owing to the ee collisions was calculated by Lampe
[13], Flowers and Itoh [14], Urpin and Yakovlev [15], and
Timmes [16]. These calculations were summarized by
Potekhin et al. [12]. The main result was that the ee col-
lisions are mainly negligible, except for a hot low-density
plasma of light elements (from hydrogen to carbon) with
the temperature a few times lower than the electron de-
generacy temperature (in that case the ee collisions did
affect κe but never dominated as long as the electrons
were degenerate; see Lampe [13]; Urpin and Yakovlev
[15]).
However, all these calculations have neglected an im-

portant effect of the Landau damping of the ee interac-
tion owing to the exchange of transverse plasmons. In the
context of transport properties of dense matter this effect
was studied by Heiselberg and Pethick [17] for degener-
ate quark plasmas. Similar effects have recently been
analyzed by Jaikumar, Gale and Page [18] for neutrino
bremsstrahlung radiation in the ee collisions. Here we
reconsider κee including the effects of the Landau damp-
ing and show that κee is actually much more important
than thought before.

II. FORMALISM

We analyze the thermal conductivity κee of strongly
degenerate electrons under the conditions that the elec-
trons constitute an almost ideal and uniform Fermi gas
and collide between themselves and with plasma ions.
Although the results will be more important for ultrarel-
ativistic electrons, our consideration will be general and
valid for both, relativistic and non-relativistic, cases. We
will use the same standard variational approach with the
simplest trial non-equilibrium electron distribution func-
tion as Flowers and Itoh [14]. The calculations are similar
to those performed by Heiselberg and Pethick [17] for the
thermal conductivity of quarks; thus we omit the details.
Following Heiselberg and Pethick [17] we have

lision event; f is the electron Fermi-Dirac distribution,
and W (12|1′2′) is the differential transition probability

W (12|1′2′) = 4 (2π~)6 δ(ε′1 + ε′2 − ε1 − ε2)
×δ(p′1 + p′2 − p1 − p2) |Mfi|2, (4)

|Mfi|2 being the squared matrix element summed over
electron spin states. The symmetry factors required to
avoid double counting of the same initial and final elec-
tron states are also included into |Mfi|2.
The multi-dimensional integral (3) is simplified fur-

ther using the standard angular-energy decomposition
(separating integrations over particle energies and ori-
entations of their momenta; e.g., Shapiro and Teukol-
sky [19]). Because the electrons are strongly degener-
ate, they can participate in thermal conduction only if
their energies are close to the Fermi level. Accordingly,
their momenta can be placed at the Fermi surface in an-
gular integrals whenever possible. Characteristic energy
transfers ~ω ≡ ε′1 − ε1 in collisions of strongly degener-
ate particles are small, ~ω . kBT . Momentum transfers
~q ≡ p′1 − p1 are also small, ~q ≪ pe, owing to a long-
range nature of the Coulomb interaction. We will use this
small-momentum-transfer approximation throughout the
paper. Typical values of ~q are determined by plasma
screening of the Coulomb interaction.
The plasma screening was thoroughly analyzed by

Heiselberg and Pethick [17]. These authors studied
quark-quark interaction through one-gluon exchange in
the weak-coupling limit which is very similar to the
Coulomb interaction in an ordinary plasma. The matrix

ized electron bispinor (ūeue = 2mec

2), and ūe is a Dirac

[20]). The longitudinal component of Je′e (parallel to
q) is related to the time-like (charge density) component

e′e via current continuity equation; it is excluded from

Eq. (5), see Ref. [17].
The polarization functions Πl and Πt in Eq. (5) de-

pend on ω and q and describe the plasma screening of
the ee interaction through the exchange of longitudinal
and transverse plasmons, respectively. In the classical
limit (~q ≪ pe and ~ω ≪ vepe), taking into account
the polarization produced by degenerate electrons in the
first-order random phase approximation, one has (e.g.,
Alexandrov, Bogdankevich and Rukhadze [21])

q0 being the ordinary Thomas-Fermi electron screening
wavenumber. Particularly, in the limit of ω → 0 and
ω/q ≪ ve we have

χl = 1, χt = i πω/(4qve). (9)

According to Eqs. (5) and (6), the plasma screening of
the ee current interaction via the exchange of transverse
plasmons (the second term in Eq. (5)) is different from
the screening of the charge interaction via the exchange of
longitudinal plasmons (the first term). The difference re-
sults from the difference of the polarization functions Πt
and Πl and has been neglected in all previous calculations
of the electron thermal conductivity (where one has com-
monly set Πt = Πl = q

2
0 , and q

2− (ω/c)2+Πt = q2+ q20).
Naturally, this difference is expected to be small for non-
relativistic electrons (ve ≪ c), where the transverse cur-
rent interaction term is small in the matrix element. We
will see that the difference becomes important for rela-
tivistic electrons (ve ≈ c).



3

Let us recall that the functions Πl and Πt have real
parts which describe plasmon refraction, and imaginary
parts which describe plasmon absorption. In the ee
scattering we deal with low-energy virtual plasmons,
~ω . kBT . As seen from Eq. (9), longitudinal plas-
mons undergo refraction which results in the Debye-type
(Thomas-Fermi) screening of the Coulomb interaction,
with the screening momentum (inverse screening length)
q0. As for transverse plasmons, they mainly undergo col-
lisionless absorption (that is the Landau damping) by
degenerate electrons. Their effect is drastically different
from the effect of longitudinal plasmons.
The calculations similar to those in Ref. [17] lead to

the following expressions for the ee collision frequency

M
(1)
fi and M

fi , give equal contributions into Eq. (11),

and the interference term is negligibly small because of
the small-momentum-transfer approximation. Further-
more, w = ~ω/kBT ; φ is the angle between p1t and p2t,
the components of p1 and p2 transverse to q; and the
integration over φ is trivial. Equations (10) and (11) are
natural generalizations of Eqs. (58) and (59) of Heisel-
berg and Pethick [17] to the case of a degenerate gas
of particles of arbitrary degree of relativity (in our case
v/c may be arbitrary while in Ref. [17] v = c). The dif-
ference of numerical factors in the expressions for κ in
our Eq. (10) and in Eq. (58) of Ref. [17] (108 versus 24)
stems from the difference of physical systems under con-
sideration (an electron gas versus a gas of light quarks
interacting through gluon exchange).

III. FOUR REGIMES OF

ELECTRON-ELECTRON COLLISIONS

Thus the collision frequency and the thermal conduc-
tivity (10) are solely determined by the electron number

density and the temperature. Their calculation reduces
to the calculation of the function I(u, θ) from Eq. (11).
Clearly, the function can be written as

I = Il + It + Ilt, (13)

where Il is the contribution from the ee interaction via
the exchange of longitudinal plasmons (the first term in
the squared modulus); It comes from the interaction via
the exchange of transverse plasmons (the second term);
and Ilt is the mixed term.
The analysis reveals four regimes (I–IV) of ee collisions

in a strongly degenerate electron gas. These regimes are
summarized in Table I. The regimes I and II are realized
for non-relativistic electrons, while in the regimes III and
IV electrons are ultrarelativistic. The regimes I and III
take place for sufficiently high temperatures T & Tpe, at
which the Pauli principle does not restrict energy trans-
fers between colliding electrons (~ω < kBT ; see, e.g.,
Lampe [13], especially his Fig. 1). The regimes II and
IV refer to a colder electron gas, where energy transfers
are essentially limited by the Pauli blocking (e.g., Lampe
[13] and Flowers and Itoh [14]).
The analysis of Eq. (11) gives the following asymptotic

values of I in the different regimes.
In the regime I (where u . 1 and θ . 1)

. (14)

The logarithmic terms in brackets represent Coulomb
logarithms, while the second terms are the corrections
calculated using the standard technique [13]. The lead-
ing contribution comes from Il. It was calculated by
Lampe [13], with a slightly less accurate correction term
(1.30× 2/15 ≈ 0.173 from his Eqs. (5.22) and (5.23), in-
stead of our 0.1657). Retaining this term in the regime
I, one has I = Il and

κee =
5π3k3BT

72α2~2c2 [ln(1/θ) + 1.242]

. (15)

IV ve ≈ c T ≪ Tpe It const

Note that for It the regime I extends to lower tempera-
tures T ∼ uTpe, than for Il and Ilt, but this circumstance
does not affect noticeably the thermal conductivity κee
because It is relatively insignificant in the given regime.
In the regime III (where u ≈ 1 and θ . 1),

Il = 2It =

+ 0.3884. (16)

Again, the logarithmic terms are Coulomb logarithms
and the second terms are corrections. In this case, all
terms (Il, It, and Ilt) give comparable contributions into
I. The asymptote of I in this regime was obtained
by Heiselberg and Pethick [17] (their Eq. (60), with a
slightly less accurate correction factor 0.30 instead of our
0.3884) in their studies of quark plasma. For an elec-
tron plasma, the conductivity κee in the regime III was
calculated by Urpin and Yakovlev [15]. Their result is
equivalent to Eq. (16) for I but with less accurate cor-
rection (ln(2)/3 ≈ 0.231 instead of 0.3884) because they
erroneously used the approximation of static longitudi-
nal electron screening of the Coulomb interaction in all
terms (with Πl = Πt = q

2
0 in Eq. (6)). Employing I from

Eq. (16) in the regime III we obtain

κee =

≈ 18.52,

where ζ(z) is the Riemann zeta function (with ζ(3) =
1.202) and Γ(z) is the gamma function. The expres-
sion for It (with u = 1) was obtained by Heiselberg and
Pethick [17] for an ultrarelativistic quark plasma.
The asymptotic expressions (18) are derived from

Eq. (11) with the screening functions χl and χt given
by Eq. (9). In this approximation the screening of the
ee interaction via the exchange of longitudinal plasmons
(the first part of the matrix element in Eq. (5)) is de-
scribed by q2 + Πl ≈ q2 + q20 , which is equivalent to the
static Debye-type screening with the screening wavenum-
ber qscr,l = q0. The screening via the exchange of trans-
verse plasmons (the second part of the matrix element)
is more complicated. It is described by the denominator
term q2 − ω2/c2 +Πt ≈ q2 + iq20πωve/(4qc2) that repre-
sents the dynamical screening via the Landau damping
of transverse plasmons, with ~ω ∼ kBT ≪ ve~q (i.e.,
with low phase velocities ω/q ≪ ve). In this case the ef-
fective screening wavenumber qscr,t is evidently given by
q3scr,t ∼ q20ωve/c2 ∼ q20kBTve/(~c2).

Using Eqs. (10) and (13) we can decompose the col-
lision frequency νee into the same parts as I, νee =

ν
(l)
ee + ν

(t)
ee + ν

(lt)
ee . One can easily see, that in the regimes

II and IV the partial frequency ν
(l)
ee can be estimated as

ν
(l)
ee ∼ neα2(kBT )2/(~q3scr,lµ). The collision frequency
ν

(t)
ee can be estimated as ν

(t)
ee ∼ u4 ν(l)ee by replacing

qscr,l → qscr,t. The factor u4 takes into account the re-
duction of the ee interaction via transverse plasmons in

the nonrelativistic electron gas. The quantity ν
(lt)
ee can

be estimated as ν
(lt)
ee ∼ u2 ν(l)ee with q3scr,l → q2scr,l qscr,t.

In the regime II, where θ & 1 and u ≪ 1, the exchange
of longitudinal plasmons dominates, and we have I ≈ Il,

κee =
5~q30v

4
e

36π2Tα2c2
. (19)

This leading part of κee in the regime II was calculated
by Lampe [13]. Note that the asymptotic expression (18)
for It at u ≪ 1 is actually valid not at T . Tpe, as the
expressions for Il and Ilt, but at lower T . uTpe. How-
ever, this circumstance is relatively unimportant because
it is Il which dominates in the regime II.
In the regime IV, where θ & 1 and u ≈ 1, the exchange

of transverse plasmons dominates, with I ≈ It, and

κee =
π3kBcq

2
0

216 ζ(3)α2
. (20)

It is remarkable that in this regime κee becomes temper-
ature independent. This regime has been discussed in
detail by Heiselberg and Pethick [17] for quark plasma.
For the electron plasma, it was considered by Flow-
ers and Itoh [14] and also by Urpin and Yakovlev [15]
but both groups erroneously used the approximation of
static longitudinal screening in all channels (χl = χt =
1) which strongly underestimates the efficiency of the
plasma screening of the ee interaction in the ultrarela-
tivistic electron gas. If that approximation were true,

one would obtain ν
(l)
ee = ν

(lt)
ee = 2ν

(t)
ee and νee = 2.5ν

(l)
ee ,

whereas in fact ν
(l)
ee ≪ ν(lt)ee ≪ ν(t)ee in the regime IV, and

κee is significantly lower than predicted by the previous
calculations [14, 15].
Let us note that the temperature behavior of κee (Ta-

ble I) corresponds to an ordinary Fermi-liquid (where
κ ∝ 1/T ; e.g., Baym and Pethick [22]) only in the regime
II. In the regimes I and III the plasma is too warm (al-
though degenerate) to reach the Fermi-liquid limit, where
energy transfers between colliding particles are strongly
restricted by the Pauli principle. In the regime IV the
plasma is cold but the matrix element of the ee interac-
tion essentially depends on energy transfers ~ω owing to
the Landau damping of transverse plasmons which vio-
lates the Fermi-liquid behavior [17].
To facilitate applications, we have calculated the func-

tions Il, It and Ilt from Eq. (11) for a dense grid of u and
θ and fitted the numerical data by analytic functions. We

obtain

where the electrons become nondegenerate) and 8.4% (at

tal function I in Eq. (13) is 2.5% (at u = 0.924 and
θ = 0.232).

IV. DISCUSSION

Let us discuss the efficiency of ee collisions for thermal
conduction in a degenerate electron gas. Figure 1 shows
the temperature-density diagram for a dense matter. For
certainty, we have adopted the model of cold-catalyzed
(ground-state) matter. It is composed of electrons and
ions (atomic nuclei) at densities smaller than the neutron
drip density ρnd ≈ 4×1011 g cm−3 (the right vertical dot-
ted line), with an addition of free neutrons at higher den-
sities ρ. The composition of the cold-catalyzed matter is
taken from Haensel and Pichon [23] at ρ < ρnd and from
Negele and Vautherin [24] at higher ρ. Weak first-oder
phase transitions which accompany changes of ground-
state nuclides with the growth of ρ are smoothed out as
described by Kaminker et al. [25]. At ρ . 108 g cm−3

the ground-state matter is composed of iron (56Fe). The
densities ρ . 109 g cm−3 are appropriate for degenerate
stellar cores of white dwarfs and evolved stars; the den-
sities ρ . 1014 are appropriate for envelopes (crusts) of
neutron stars.

Figure 1: (color online) Temperature-density diagram for
cold-catalyzed matter. We show the electron degeneracy tem-
perature TF, the electron plasma temperature Tpe, the melt-
ing temperature Tm of the ion crystal, and the ion plasma
temperature Tpi. The left dotted line separates the regions
of a low-density non-relativistic electron gas and a denser gas
of ultrarelativistic electrons. The right dotted line indicates
the neutron drip point. Shaded regions I–IV show the T − ρ
domains of the different ee collision regimes (Table I).

In Figure 1 we plot the electron degeneracy temper-
ature TF = (µ − mec2)/kB, the electron plasma tem-
perature Tpe, the melting temperature of the ion crystal
Tm ≈ Z2i e2/(175akB), and the ion plasma temperature

In order to explore the importance of the ee collisions
for thermal conduction let us compare κee with the ther-
mal conductivity κei owing to ei collisions (Section I).
The conductivity κei is calculated using the formalism of
Potekhin et al. [12] and Gnedin et al. [6].

In Figure 2 we plot the temperature dependence of the
electron thermal conductivity of helium (4He) or carbon
(12C) plasmas at ρ = 105 g cm−3 (left) or 106 g cm−3

(right). At ρ = 105 g cm−3 the electrons are nonrelativis-
tic while at ρ = 106 g cm−3 they are mildly relativistic.
According to Eq. (2), the total electron thermal conduc-
tivity κe is determined by the partial contributions κee

nal plasmons alone. The dot-and-dashed lines show κei and

and κei, a minimum partial contribution being most im-
portant. The total conductivities are shown by the solid
lines; κei by the dot-and-dashed lines; κee is plotted by
the dashed lines (the same for the helium and carbon
plasmas); the dotted lines give κee neglecting the contri-
bution of transverse plasmons (i.e., by setting I = Il).

For the densities and temperatures displayed in Figure
2, the ei collisions are mainly more efficient than the ee
ones, although the contribution of the ee collisions into
the total thermal conductivity is noticeable. One can
see that the ei collisions are more important for heavier
elements (because the Coulomb ei scattering cross sec-
tion is much higher than the ee scattering cross section
for high-Z elements; see Lampe [13]). The ee collisions
would be negligible for the iron plasma if the data for this
plasma were displayed in Figure 2. The ee collisions are
more efficient in the helium plasma than in the carbon
plasma because the helium ions have lower charges. For
a given chemical composition, κee gives highest contri-
bution into κe at temperatures T a few times lower than
Tpe (we have log10 Tpe[K] ≈ 7.86 and 8.32 at ρ = 105 and
106 g cm−3, respectively). These temperatures separate
the high-temperature and low-temperature ee collision
regimes (e.g., the regimes I and II in the non-relativistic
electron gas, see Table I). For ρ = 105 g cm−3, the elec-
tron gas is only slightly relativistic. Accordingly, the con-
tribution of the Landau damping (transverse plasmons)
into κee is relatively small, and the results of Lampe [13]
are sufficiently accurate. For higher ρ = 106 g cm−3,
the contribution of the Landau damping becomes more
important which invalidates the previous results of Refs.
[14, 15]. In this case the Landau damping strongly re-
duces κee which makes the ee collisions much more im-
portant for thermal conduction than it was thought be-
fore. For still higher ρ the contribution of κee into κe
in a plasma of light elements at T ∼ Tpe would be even
more significant. However, the temperature Tpe would

addition, the lower dot-and-dashed line at T = 107 K shows
κei which includes the contribution of electron scattering by
impurity nuclei at T = 107 K (for nimp/ni = 0.05 and |Zimp−
Zi| = 2). The dashed line is κee; it is almost independent of

T . The dotted line is the partial conductivity κ

become so high that light elements would start burning
in thermonuclear reactions. Therefore, ee collisions can
noticeably decrease the electron thermal conductivity at
densities and temperatures important for nuclear burn-
ing of light elements (for instance, in the vicinity of the
carbon ignition curve). This should be taken into ac-
count in simulations of nuclear evolution of stars (e.g.,
carbon ignition in white dwarfs [4]).

Figure 3 shows the density dependence of the elec-
tron thermal conductivity in the density range from
∼ 2.5 × 109 g cm−3 to 1014 g cm−3 for the three val-
ues of the temperature T = 107, 108, and 109 K. We
employ the same model of ground-state matter as in Fig-
ure 1. The displayed density range is appropriate to a
crust of a neutron star. The vertical dotted line is the
neutron drip point which separates the crust into the
outer and inner parts. The adopted values of T and ρ
refer to the regime IV of the ee collisions, where the elec-
tron gas is ultrarelativistic, T ≪ Tpe, and the Landau
damping dominates. The conductivity κee (the dashed
line) is well approximated by the temperature indepen-

dent conductivity (20) governed by the Landau damping;
κee slightly deviates from Eq. (20) only at lowest ρ for
T = 109 in Figure 3, where T is still insufficiently lower
than Tpe (see Figure 1). Retaining the longitudinal con-
tribution into κee (I = Il) and setting T = 10

8 K, we
would get the dotted curve in Fig. 3. It goes much higher
than the dashed curve indicating that this longitudinal
contribution is really insignificant.

For comparison, the dot-and-dashed lines in Figure 3
give the thermal conductivity κei (mostly from Figure 4
of Ref. [6]) for the same values of T , and the solid lines
give the total conductivity κe. For T = 10

8 and 109,
the effects of possible impurities in dense matter (atomic
nuclei with charge numbers Zimp different from charge
numbers Zi of ground-state nuclei) are expected to be
small (e.g., Gnedin et al. [6]). At T = 107 K, the effects
of impurities can be substantial. For this T in Figure
3 we present κei and κe for pure ground-state matter
and also for the matter which contains impurities with
|Zimp − Zi| = 2 and with the fractional number of im-
purity nuclei of nimp/ni = 0.05. The impurities increase
the ei collision rate and decrease the conductivities κei
and κe.

As seen from Figure 3, κei is more important than κee
at all displayed densities for T = 108 and 109 K. In these
cases κe ≈ κei and we do not show κe to simplify the
figure. However, κee dominates in the pure ground-state
matter for T = 107 K at ρ & 1012 g cm−3 (in the inner
crust of a neutron star). This dominance is fully pro-
duced by the Landau damping of transverse plasmons in
the ee-collisions. For ρ & 1013 g cm−3 in this case we
have κe ≈ κee. For an impure cold-catalyzed matter κei
remains important for all densities at T = 107 K, but
κee is comparable to κei in the inner neutron star crust.
Note that the values of κei in Figure 3 take into account,
in an approximate manner, the freezing of Umklapp pro-
cesses in electron-phonon scattering at low temperatures
(see, e.g., Ref. [6]). For T & 108 K the freezing is unim-
portant, but at T ∼ 107 K it enhances κei. A more rig-
orous treatment of this freezing can partly remove this
enhancement (A. I. Chugunov, private communication),
which can somewhat decrease κei and reduce the impor-
tance of κee.

Therefore, a correct treatment of ee collisions can con-
siderably reduce the electron thermal conductivity in a
cold neutron star crust, with T ∼ 107 K. This can in-
crease the time of heat diffusion from the inner crust to
the surface [9]. In particular, the effect can be impor-
tant for the propagation of thermal waves produced by
pulsar glitches and for the emergence of these waves on
the pulsar surface. The emergence can be, in principle,
observed and give valuable information on the nature of
pulsar glitches [8].

While calculating κee we have taken into account only
the electron contribution into the polarization functions
Πl and Πt in Eq. (6) and neglected the ion contribution.
As shown by Lampe [13] this is a good approximation
at high temperatures T & Z2e2/(akB) at which the ions

are weakly coupled and constitute a Boltzmann gas. The
calculation of the ion polarization functions at lower T
(in the regime of strong ion coupling, in an ion liquid
or solid) is a complicated problem whose detailed solu-
tion is still absent. We have also neglected the effects of
strong magnetic fields which can greatly modify electron
heat transport in strongly magnetized neutron star en-
velopes. These effects are numerous (e.g., Yakovlev and
Kaminker [26]) and are subdivided into classical (owing
to rapid electron Larmor rotation) and quantum ones
(owing to the Landau quantization of electron motion in
a magnetic field). In principle, a proper treatment of ee
collisions in a strong magnetic field can be performed in
the same framework of the dynamical plasma screening as
used above. However, the problem becomes much more
complicated because the electron polarization tensor in a
magnetic field is anisotropic (depends on the relative ori-
entations of the wavevector q and the magnetic field) and
cannot be generally decomposed into purely longitudinal
and transverse parts [21]. The effects of ion polarization
and strong magnetic fields are outside the scope of the
present paper.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have reconsidered the electron thermal conductiv-
ity κee of degenerate electrons produced owing to the
ee collisions taking into account the Landau damping
due to the exchange of transverse plasmons (following
the calculations of kinetic properties of quark plasma by
Heiselberg and Pethick [17]). The Landau damping has
been neglected in all previous calculations of κee. We
have analyzed the four regimes of the ee collisions in the
degenerate electron gas (Section III, Table I) and ob-
tained analytic expressions for κee which accurately ap-
proximate the results of numerical calculations of κee in
wide ranges of the temperature and density of the matter.
These results can be applied to study thermal conduction
of degenerate electrons in metals, semiconductors, in de-
generate cores of evolved stars and white dwarfs, and in
envelopes of neutron stars.
Our main conclusions are the following.
(1) The Landau damping strongly modifies κee in a

relativistic degenerate electron gas, at densities ρ &
106 g cm−3, but it is also quite noticeable at lower ρ
(for instance, at ρ = 105 g cm−3, see Figure 2). The Lan-
dau damping increases the ee collision rate and decreases
κee, increasing the contribution of the ee collisions into
the total electron thermal conductivity κe.
(2) The most dramatic effect of the Landau damping

on κee takes place at ρ ≫ 106 g cm−3 for temperatures
T much below the electron plasma temperature Tpe (the
regime IV, Table I). In this case κee shows a non-Fermi-
liquid behavior; it becomes temperature independent and
is described by the asymptotic expression (20).
(3) The conductivity κee becomes comparable to

the electron thermal conductivity κei provided by the



8

electron-ion collisions (and gives thus a noticeable contri-
bution into the total conductivity κe) in a warm plasma
of light (low-Z) ions at temperatures T a few times lower
than Tpe (Figure 2). These conditions are typical for
degenerate cores of white dwarfs and giant stars where
thermonuclear burning of light elements can occur (par-
ticularly, in the vicinity of the carbon ignition curve).
(4) The conductivity κee dominates over κei and de-

termines the total electron thermal conductivity κe of
the dense pure cold-catalyzed matter at T ∼ 107 K and
ρ & 1012 g cm−3 (in the inner crust of a cold neutron
star, Figure 3). At these T and ρ the conductivity κee
is important even for impure cold-catalyzed matter. It
can affect the propagation of thermal waves, excited in
the inner neutron star crust during pulsar glitches, to the
pulsar surface.
The electron conductivity κe operates also in neutron

star cores, at ρ & 1.5 × 1014 g cm−3. This conductiv-

ity should also be reconsidered taking into account the
Landau damping. Our present results cannot be directly
applied to this case because in the cores the electrons col-
lide efficiently at least with degenerate electrons, muons,
and protons, and these collisions deserve a special study.
We intend to analyze them in a subsequent publication.
